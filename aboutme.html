<body style = "background-color: orange;"
	<p>My name is Yvonne, but my friends call me Bon Bon.</p>
	<p> I'm captain of the step team of my school. Lots of people think step is just a bunch of angry girls, or boys in some cases stomping and claping randomly. However, step takes a lot of precision and unison because without the whole team on point, the step will collapse. On another note, one of my favorite interests is to listen to music. I also like to just relax by myself because I enjoy my own company. Trying new foods and going out to eat is what I do as well. As you might have noticed my favorite color is orange. I'm a rising senior and I am ready to be done with high school so bad! My face seems really mean and serious sometimes, but when you actually get to know me I'm really funny and chill.</p>
